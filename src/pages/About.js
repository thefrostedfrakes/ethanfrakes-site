          I am a software and AI researcher and developer with a strong focus on cutting-edge technologies that bridge structured knowledge and intelligent systems. 
          My current work primarily focuses on the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Generative AI.
          I explore ways to make unstructured and unlinked data into a more interoperable and semantically-enriched format.
          I am especially as of current heavily involved in Semantic Web technologies that assist in disaster mitigation following power outages, as well as in materials science and energy production/resilience.<br/><br/>

          Currently, I'm working at the University of Central Florida HENAT Lab with Dr. Mengjie Li on Semantic Data, Knowledge Graphs, and GNNs. 
          We're developing GeoOutageKG, a multimodal knowledge graph that links different power outage datasets together into one that captures both a high spatial and temporal resolution.
          We're also exploring methods on how to incorporate GeoOutageKG with LLMs for retrieving outage data using natural language as an interface.<br/><br/>

          Outside of my professional interests, I am an avid enthusiast of Astronomy, Tech, Robotics, History, Films &amp; Filmmaking, Science Fiction, and a lot more.
          But in many occasions, I find it important to enjoy the small things in life: having parties and going out with good friends, going for a good nature walk, and enjoying life with others.
          If you would like to reach out to talk about some of my professional work, or if you just would like to chat about common interests, feel free to contact me at any time!
