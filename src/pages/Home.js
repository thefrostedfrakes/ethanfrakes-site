          Hello! This is the website for the one and only (not actually only but let's pretend so) Ethan Frakes.
          Here, you'll find my professional portfolio containing various projects I have or have been working on, my experience, skills, and publications.
          I've also included some points of contact if you would like to reach out; feel free to at any time!
          I may expand this website in the future to include things like a blog and my various personal/professional interests. 
          Whether you're a professional or just an random voyager on the Internet, welcome to my site!
        </p>
